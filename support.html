                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What makes JReader different from other text-to-speech apps?</h4>
                    <p>JReader features advanced neural voice models that provide natural-sounding speech with proper pronunciation of complex words, names, and technical terms. The app processes everything locally on your device for privacy and works completely offline.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How do I add text to JReader?</h4>
                    <p>You can add text through multiple methods:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use the camera to scan text from documents, books, or images</li>
                        <li>Paste text from other apps using copy/paste</li>
                        <li>Import text files from other applications</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Does JReader collect any of my data?</h4>
                    <p>No. JReader does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. Your privacy is our priority. All text processing and speech synthesis occurs locally on your device using on-device machine learning.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Can I use JReader offline?</h4>
                    <p>Yes! JReader works completely offline. Once installed, you don't need an internet connection to use any of the app's features, including text-to-speech conversion and document scanning.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>What voices are available?</h4>
                    <p>JReader includes multiple high-quality voices:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Male and female voice options</li>
                        <li>Natural-sounding neural voices</li>
                        <li>Advanced pronunciation for complex words</li>
                        <li>Adjustable speech rate and pitch</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>How accurate is the document scanning?</h4>
                    <p>JReader uses optical character recognition (OCR) technology to read text from images and documents. While the technology is generally reliable, accuracy may vary depending on factors like image quality, lighting, text clarity, and font styles. Similarly, the text-to-speech conversion may occasionally mispronounce complex words or technical terms. For best results, ensure text is well-lit and clearly visible, and feel free to manually correct any scanning errors before playback.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h4>Is JReader accessible for users with disabilities?</h4>
                    <p>Yes! JReader is designed with accessibility in mind and fully supports VoiceOver and other iOS accessibility features. It's particularly helpful for users with dyslexia, visual impairments, or reading difficulties.</p>
